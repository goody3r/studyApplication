Notes:

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
The process of software development

Gantt charts:
a useful tool to help project managers visualize the schedule and timeline of a project. The Gantt chart was developed by mechanical engineer Henry Gantt, in the 1910â€™s.

UML (Unified Modeling Language):
An easier way to explain Software.

Waterfall model:
A software development process developed by Dr Winston Ryce.

Stages of the waterfall model:

Problem Statement:
Establish the problem you are trying to solve

Analysis - Determining how the program should perform. The analysis should answer the following questions
    -How will they use the system?
    -Who is going to use the system?
    -How should the interface work?
    -What should the system do?
    -What input is required? What will be outputted?
    -What data will be stored? 

Design: 
Break the problem up into manageable parts and decide on  how you plan on solving the problem. Creating a general flowchart is a good way of designing a system.

Implementation:
Code the system

Integration: 
Test and compare the actual results to the projected results

Maintenance:
The maintenance stage is the stage where we fix bugs and make improvements to the program.This is also where it is most expensive to correct errors. 
For this reason, we try to correct as many errors as possible in earlier stages.
